 <h1>The best movies according to Andr√©s</h1>
 <h2>The top 3 movies that I can remember at the moment</h2>

 <hr />

<h3>The Green Book</h3>
<p>This is a movie that lets you know about the social differences and segregation that existed 
    many years ago between white and black people and how a black musician was able to overcome 
    this stigma by not fearing to stand for social justice and equality. He was accompanied all
    time by his Italian friend Tony.

<h3>John Wick</h3>
<p>The first one's the best in my opinion watched it for the first time in 2015 after a good friend
    of ours recommended it.</p>

<br />

<h3>Alien: Romulus</h3>
<p>I consider it to be the superior Alien movie to date. Excellent film by Fede Alvarez!</p>
